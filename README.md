# GSET-ROS-SIMULATION-ROBOT
Simulation of DDR (Differential Drive Robots) Using GazeboSim and RViz integrated using ROS (Robot Operating System)

This code (10,000+) have all been written for a research project at the Governor's School of Engineering and Technology over the course of two weeks in order to simulate a new PID for more accurate and applicable movement of Differential Drive Robots
